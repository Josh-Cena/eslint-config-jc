# eslint-config-jc

My personal coding style.

This is designed to be a replacement for `eslint:recommended`, `plugin:react-hooks/recommended`, `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`, and of course, everyone's favorite `airbnb`. It also extends `prettier`.

## Dependencies

It requires the following plugins:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^5.10.2",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^5.10.2",
    "eslint": "^8.8.0",
    "eslint-plugin-header": "^3.1.1",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.25.3",
    "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^6.5.1",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.27.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.3.0"
  }
}
```

Although peer dependencies are evil, we can't self-install these plugins if the downstream user depends on a different versionâ€”the wrong one will be resolved.

## Configuration

ESLint config:

```json
{
  "root": true,
  "extends": ["jc"]
}
```

Prettier config:

```json
{
  "bracketSameLine": true,
  "trailingComma": "all"
}
```

## Configuration philosophy

When analyzing whether a rule should be `error`, `warn`, or `off`, the following assumptions are made:

- ESLint is run in CI
- The editor has proper syntax highlighting and also integrates ESLint
- There are pre-commit hooks that run `eslint --fix`

Therefore, the semantic differences between `warn` or `error` are:

- An error is calling to immediate coder attention, while a warning can be delayed to the future
- Warnings can be safely `eslint-disable`'d
- Errors block CI and are never allowed in the codebase

A rule will be an error only if one of the following is true:

- This is definitely a mistake (no sane code would look like this), _or_
- This rule is fixable (and therefore doesn't block CI anyways assuming a normal development process)

A rule will be a warning if:

- There can be foreseeable false-positives, _or_
- It's stylistic

A rule will be off if:

- It enforces a style that goes against our own style guide
- It forbids a practice that we find value in

A rule will _not_ be off solely because:

- TypeScript or other rules enforce the same practice
- It enforces a practice concerning a construct that we never use in the first place

Instead, in such case, we'd rather have multiple errors.

All rules are considered as `error` by default, unless there are enough justifications to turn it into a warning or turn it off, as outlined above.
